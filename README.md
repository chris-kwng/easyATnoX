# easyATnoX

## Introduction

The easyATnoX is my modified version of of hkzlab's [ATnoX](https://github.com/hkzlab/ATnoX), which was born out of the need to have a small adapter to fit AT/XT motherboards into modern cases to power them with ATX power supplies and turn them on with a push button (the standard power button found in computer enclosures of the last 20+ years).

It is a cost-effective alternative to the [ATX2AT Smart Converter](https://x86.fr/atx2at-smart-converter/), which has a great range of functions, but functions that are not always needed, especially if it is simply a matter of operating an old mainboard in the end.

The easyATnoX is, as the name suggests, a simplified version of the [ATnoX](https://github.com/hkzlab/ATnoX) with a few important changes.

**The changes are:**


SMD and SMT components replaced by through-hole components as far as possible.
