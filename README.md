# easyATnoX

## Introduction

The easyATnoX is my modified version of of hkzlab's [ATnoX](https://github.com/hkzlab/ATnoX), which was born out of the need to have a small adapter to fit AT/XT motherboards into modern cases to power them with ATX power supplies and turn them on with a push button (the standard power button found in computer enclosures of the last 20+ years).

It is a cost-effective alternative to the [ATX2AT Smart Converter](https://x86.fr/atx2at-smart-converter/), which has a great range of functions, but functions that are not always needed, especially if it is simply a matter of operating an old mainboard in the end.

The easyATnoX is, as the name suggests, a simplified version of the [ATnoX](https://github.com/hkzlab/ATnoX) with a few important changes. In addition, it should be even cheaper to purchase/production.

:warning: | The PCB is untested so far. Furthermore, I assume no liability for any damages. Use at your own risk.

## Changes are:

- Two PCB copies were accommodated on the area of 100 x 100 mm and separated by means of mouse bites. An easyATnoX therefore has the dimensions of approximately 100 x 50 mm. The background to this is the $2 PCB offer from JLCPCB.
- The 4 layer PCB became a 2 layer PCB.
- SMD and SMT components replaced by through-hole components as far as possible.
- Diagnostic LED's for the voltages have been removed
